Changing File and Directory User or Group Ownership

- File ownership can be changed with the chown command (change owner). For example, to grant ownership of the file foofile to user student, the following command could be used:

chown student foofile

- chown can be used with the -R option to recursively change the ownership of an entire directory tree. The following command would grant ownership of foodir and all files and subdirectories within it to student:

chown -R student foodir

- The chown command can also be used to change group ownership of a file by preceding the group name with a colon (:). For example, the following command will change the group foodir to admins:

chown :admins foodir

- The chown command can also be used to change both owner and group at the same time by using the syntax owner:group. For example, to change the ownership of foodir to visitor and the group to guests, use:

chown visitor:guests foodir

OBS: Only root can change the ownership of a file. Group ownership, however, can be set by root or the file's owner. root can grant ownership to any group, while non-root users can grant ownership only to groups they belong to.

Instead of using chown, some users change the group ownership by using the chgrp command; this command works exactly the same as changing ownership with chown, including the use of -R to affect entire directory trees
