Functions

A function is a code block that implements a set of operations. Functions are useful for executing procedures multiple times, perhaps with varying input variables. Functions are also often called subroutines. Using functions in scripts requires two steps:

            Declaring a function
            Calling a function.

The function declaration requires a name which is used to invoke it. The proper syntax is:

    function_name () {
       command...
    }

For example, the following function is named display:

    display () {
       echo "This is a sample function"
    }

The function can be as long as desired and have many statements. Once defined, the function can be called later as many times as necessary. In the full example shown in the figure, we are also showing an often-used refinement: how to pass an argument to the function. The first argument can be referred to as $1, the second as $2, etc.
