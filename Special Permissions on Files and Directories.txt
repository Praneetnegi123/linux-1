Effects of Special Permissions on Files and Directories 

Special permission   Effect on files                                                                 Effect on directories

u+s (suid)           File executes as the user that owns the file, not the user that ran the file.   No effect.

g+s (sgid)           File executes as the group that owns the file.                                  Files newly created in the directory have their group owner set to match the group owner of the directory.

o+t (sticky)         No effect.                                                                      Users with write on the directory can only remove files that they own; they cannot remove or force saves to files owned   by other users.



Setting Special Permissions

- Symbolically: setuid = u+s; setgid = g+s; sticky = o+t
- Numerically (fourth preceding digit): setuid = 4; setgid = 2; sticky = 1 

Examples:

- Add the setgid bit on directory:

chmod g+s directory

- Set the setgid bit, and read/write/execute for user and group on directory:

chmod 2770 directory
