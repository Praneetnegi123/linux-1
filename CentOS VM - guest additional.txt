In The CentOS VM

Everything here needs to be done as root so either log in as root or put “sudo” in front of every command.
Update your system

Specifically you want to the latest kernel otherwise your VirtualBox modules might be built for the wrong kernel version:

yum update

Now reboot to make sure you are are running the latest kernel.
Get all the stuff required to build the VirtualBox Guest additions

yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
yum install kernel-devel

You also need dkms from the epel repository

yum install epel-release
yum install dkms

Install the guest additions

Make a place to mount the iso and then mount it.

mkdir /mnt/VBoxLinuxAdditions
mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/VBoxLinuxAdditions

Run the install script

sh /mnt/VBoxLinuxAdditions/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

That’s it. If everything went well, you can now use the additional functionality provided by the VirtualBox Guest Additions.
