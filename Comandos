Printer services
Assuming CUPS has been installed you'll need to start and manage the CUPS daemon so that CUPS is ready for configuring a printer. Managing the CUPS daemon is simple; all management features can be done with the systemctl utility:

$ systemctl status cups

$ sudo systemctl [start|stop|restart] cups
-----------------------
Calls to sudo trigger a lookup in the /etc/sudoers file, or in the /etc/sudoers.d directory, which first validates that the calling user is allowed to use sudo and that it is being used within permitted scope.

One of the most powerful features of sudo is its ability to log unsuccessful attempts at gaining root access. By default, sudo commands and failures are logged in /var/log/auth.log under the Debian family and /var/log/messages in other distribution families.
